# Hello, I am Jugal Mahida

Today is 29/11/2025 11:29AM, i started my dsa journey with Udemy Course & MasterJI App (Indian Version of Leetcode with very specific Challenges & Problems)

# Steps to construct an algorithm

1. Understand the problem definition
2. Choose the technique (Two Pointers, DP, Greedy, Divider & Conquer and many more !)
3. Dry Run (Draw Flow Chat)
4. Testing the algorithm
5. Implementation (Coding Time!)
6. Analysis of your solution (Best Time & Space complexity)

## Additional note of me

- Start the timer when program is start with technique name for better understanding
- It will showing the start time & end time for the choosing the best technique for the problem

# Big O Notation  
- O(1) = Code will runs only onces, this is also called as Constant Time complexity.
- O(n) = Code will runs n times means if n = 5 then code will runs 5 times.
